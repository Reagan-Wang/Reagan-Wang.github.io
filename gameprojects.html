            CSCI 426 Prototypes
        </h2>
        <p>
            As part of my coursework in CSCI426, Video Game Prototyping, I have made
            a number of prototypes - to be specific, one prototype every week for seven weeks, working with only one partner.
            This inevitably means that our prototypes are fairly rough and without much visual polish -
            of course, the importance of game feel was stressed throughout, and we made sure that
            despite our time constraints this element was not neglected. <br>
            <br>
            Here are a few of my favourite prototypes made in this class. 
        </p>

                        </b>
                        My partner and I decided to theme our game around painting,
                        and so we designed our game around a painting mechanic, where players
                        would try to cover the canvas with certain quantities of paint using their player
                        character as a brush, <i>a la Splatoon</i>.
                        Something we tried to take advantage of was the way this mechanic forces 
                        players to explore the entire canvas, but does not force them to do so in a linear manner - 
                        and so, a clever level designer could design levels 
                        with a number of different potential routes in mind.

                        Prompt: Make a game using only one button. <br>
                        </b>
                        Given our restriction to only one button, my partner and I thought of ways
                        to get the most out of the spacebar. Our efforts led us to <i>Toggle</i>,
                        in which the player toggles every single coloured platform on or off using
                        their spacebar. Most of our time here was spent designing levels that could
                        engage the player, as the game turned out to be a sort of physics-puzzler
                        that at times required a keen sense of timing.

                        My latent addiction to <i>Slay the Spire</i>
                        was on full display here - I proposed the concept
                        to my partner with the reasoning "what could be more discrete than cards?".
                        We decided that the game would work well if the player character
                        was something that was ordinarily controlled indirectly - like a
                        spaceship whose captain barked commands to their crew, creating a
                        thematic justification for the one-at-a-time card controls.
