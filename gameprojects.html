                        <i>Colour Coded</i> is a single-button game in which the player's objective is to move a ball to a goal
                        using a variety of special platforms whose abilities are toggled on and off by the aforementioned
                        single button.

                        This game is the result of taking one of my CSCI 426 prototypes (see below) and working on it a bit
                        more with a larger team. I'm proud of how we managed to elaborate on the simple concept and 
                        work within the restrictions inherent in it.

                <i>Spell Showdown</i> was the final project of the class CTIN-488 (Games Workshop) at USC. <i>Spell Showdown</i>
                was a challenging game to design. The main mechanic around which the gameplay revolved was rather novel - something of a blend
                of <i>Carcassonne</i> and <i>Code Names</i> - which immediately posed a rule-learning problem for us to solve. 
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                As lead designer, I was challenged to write a set of rules that could clearly and concisely the mechanics I wanted to convey - even
                recording a video explanation of the rules with the hypothesis that it would be a more natural way to teach the rules.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    Success on this front was mixed - the concept inherently did not lend itself well to being picked up quickly, particularly by players
                    inexperienced with board games. 
                    However, we did find improvements as we iterated on our instructions based off playtest feedback. 
                    The result was a game that, although tricky to learn, was interesting and compelling mechanically.

            CSCI 426 Prototypes

        <p>
            As part of my coursework in CSCI426, Video Game Prototyping, I  made
            a number of prototypes - to be specific, one prototype every week for seven weeks, working with only one partner.
            This inevitably meant that our prototypes were fairly rough and without much visual polish.
            Our priority was to explore potential design spaces as quickly as possible in order to find ideas that could be fleshed out.<br>
            <br>
            Here are a few of my favourite prototypes made in this class.

                        </b>
                        My partner and I decided to theme our game around painting,
                        and so we designed our game around a painting mechanic, where players
                        would try to cover the canvas with certain quantities of paint using their player
                        character as a brush, <i>a la Splatoon</i>.
                        Something we tried to take advantage of was the way this mechanic forces 
                        players to explore the entire canvas, but does not force them to do so in a linear manner - 
                        and so, a clever level designer could design levels 
                        with a number of different potential routes in mind.

                        Prompt: Make a game using only one button. <br>
                        </b>
                        Given our restriction to only one button, my partner and I thought of ways
                        to get the most out of the spacebar. Our efforts led us to <i>Toggle</i>,
                        in which the player toggles every single coloured platform on or off using
                        their spacebar. The game was pretty easy programming-wise - most of our time here was spent designing engaging levels, as the game turned out to be a sort of physics-puzzler
                        that at times required a keen sense of timing. This game ended up being chosen
                        to be taken further, and my partner and I got to add two of our classmates to
                        polish the game for a couple of weeks.

                        My latent addiction to <i>Slay the Spire</i>
                        was on full display here - I proposed the concept
                        to my partner with the reasoning "what could be more discrete than playing cards?".
                        We decided that the game would work well if the player character
                        was something that was ordinarily controlled indirectly - like a
                        spaceship whose captain barked commands to their crew, creating a
                        thematic justification for the one-at-a-time card controls. The prototype resulted in
                        an intriguing potential design space which would marry deckbuilding elements with real-time strategy.
