                        <i>Colour Coded</i> is a single-button game in which the player's objective is to move a ball to a goal
                        using a variety of special platforms whose abilities are toggled on and off by the aforementioned
                        single button.

                        This game is the result of taking one of my CSCI 426 prototypes (see below) and working on it a bit
                        more with a larger team. I'm proud of how we managed to elaborate on the simple concept and 
                        work within the restrictions inherent in it.

        <p>

            As part of my coursework in CSCI426, Video Game Prototyping, I have made
            a number of prototypes - to be specific, one prototype every week for seven weeks, working with only one partner.
            This inevitably means that our prototypes are fairly rough and without much visual polish -
            of course, the importance of game feel was stressed throughout, and we made sure that
            despite our time constraints this element was not neglected. <br>
            <br>
            Here are a few of my favourite prototypes made in this class.

                        </b>
                        My partner and I decided to theme our game around painting,
                        and so we designed our game around a painting mechanic, where players
                        would try to cover the canvas with certain quantities of paint using their player
                        character as a brush, <i>a la Splatoon</i>.
                        Something we tried to take advantage of was the way this mechanic forces 
                        players to explore the entire canvas, but does not force them to do so in a linear manner - 
                        and so, a clever level designer could design levels 
                        with a number of different potential routes in mind.

                        Prompt: Make a game using only one button. <br>
                        </b>
                        Given our restriction to only one button, my partner and I thought of ways
                        to get the most out of the spacebar. Our efforts led us to <i>Toggle</i>,
                        in which the player toggles every single coloured platform on or off using
                        their spacebar. The game was pretty easy programming-wise - most of our time here was spent designing engaging levels, as the game turned out to be a sort of physics-puzzler
                        that at times required a keen sense of timing. This game ended up being chosen
                        to be taken further, and my partner and I got to add two of our classmates to
                        polish the game for a couple of weeks.

                        My latent addiction to <i>Slay the Spire</i>
                        was on full display here - I proposed the concept
                        to my partner with the reasoning "what could be more discrete than cards?".
                        We decided that the game would work well if the player character
                        was something that was ordinarily controlled indirectly - like a
                        spaceship whose captain barked commands to their crew, creating a
                        thematic justification for the one-at-a-time card controls. I was proud of
                        the card system I coded (C# inheritance, thank you very much) which implemented
                        a fully-functional hand/discard/draw pile system with shuffling.
