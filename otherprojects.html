        <p>
            Before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a university degree, I was in a band called Doubtful Sound.
            I named it that because at the time, our music was of...dubious quality. 
            However, as we grew as musicians and as people, we actually became quite listenable -
            highlights include 2nd place at a regional music competition, and the release of a sole self-titled album.
            <br>
            Though no longer active, I cherish the time I spent in this band greatly as one of my
            formative experiences in my growth as a creative.
