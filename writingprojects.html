    <h3>Umurangi Generation Narrative Analysis</h3>
    <p>In the first semester of my sophomore year at USC, I entered the Game Developers Conference's narrative analysis competition.
        I decided to write my analysis on <i>Umurangi Generation</i>, a game about the end of the world set in my home country of Aotearoa, New Zealand.
        For my efforts I was fortunate enough to be rewarded with a Gold Award, paying for my pass to GDC 2024 and continuing USC's streak
        of failing to produce any platinum award winners.
